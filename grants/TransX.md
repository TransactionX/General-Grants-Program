# General Grant Proposal

* **Project:** TransX

## Project Overview :page_facing_up: 

TransX is a digital currency aggregation payment platform. Payment as mining and obtaining token distribution to solve the bitcoin "halving end effect", and its inflation economic model complements the Bitcoin deflation model.

### Overview

  - TransX is short for TransactionX, and the first phase of TransX had only one problem to solve, and that was the relocation of Bitcoin. Bitcoin was originally envisioned by Satoshi Nakamoto as a point-to-point electronic cash, but it is currently positioned as a value storage SoV, a novel electronic gold. Such positioning will make Bitcoin fall into a "gold trap". Bitcoin's "halving end effort" must be addressed if it is to return to the payment world and take advantage of the huge value of the Bitcoin network.
  
  - The "halving end effect" of Bitcoin means that at the end of the halving of Bitcoin, block rewards become less and less, while the increase of fees cannot make up for the loss caused by the halving of block rewards, which leads to the dilemma of shrinking computing power of Bitcoin network.
  
  - TransX rewards the payment of the Bitcoin network by distributing its own token, and the commission consumed by the Bitcoin network is rewarded for mining on the TransX network. Of course, TransX, as a converged payment platform, does not only reward the Bitcoin network, but also the payment behavior of multiple networks such as Ethereum and Polkadot.
  
  - TransX promotes the payment of Bitcoin, and also promotes the increase of the bitcoin network commission fee, which leads to the increase of the commission fee of single transfer on the Bitcoin network. This will reposition bitcoin. First, The Bitcoin Network +TransX network will become an enhanced payment network, making TransX a part of the inflation of this payment network. Secondly, it will increase the total market value of Bitcoin by 1-2 orders of magnitude, making bitcoin a global trade settlement currency, parallel to the centralized US dollar.

### Project Details 

TransX (Transaction X) is a digital currency aggregation payment platform, which will take the lead in supporting major cryptocurrencies, including DCEP, USDT, BTC, ETH, EOS, DOT, ADA, Dash, etc. The focus of TransX is to maximize the simple function of aggregate payment for both merchants and ordinary users, and make more third-party wallets compatible with the payment QR code. Just like the innovations made by Alipay and WeChat in the field of mobile payment, a small QR code distributed to all corners of the life circle, it can form a huge network effect. TransX runs on a network with blockchain enabled and provides the transaction services for digital currency payment. Users and merchants as miners can earn token rewards when the payment process be completed. 

TransX will use Substrate to build the application-specific blockchain. Substrate, as a next generation blockchain framework, has already been used in Polkadot network and so on, and becomes a blockchain operating system.

TransX's vision of aggregating digital currency payments can cooperate with Polkadot's cross-chain, and digital assets can cross-chain and interoperate with the Polkadot ecosystem. At a practical level, people need an aggregate payment portal to facilitate the use of digital currencies. Polkadot is the
implementation of digital asset interoperation on-chain, and TransX is a digital currency platform that helps users off-chain to aggregate payments through blockchains.

### Ecosystem Fit 

TransX issues a total of 21 million encrypted digital tokens called DCAP (Digital Currency Aggregate Payment), which is halved every 4 years. 10% of DCAP will be distributed to the founding team and the operation team for engineering, ongoing development, marketing, and more. In order to comply with most national laws and regulations, TransX does not conduct public offering, private placement or ICO.

### Milestone 1 Example — Implement Substrate Modules 
* **Estimated Duration:** 6 month
* **FTE:**  5-8
* **Costs:** $1000

| Number | Deliverable | Specification |
| ------------- | ------------- | ------------- |
| 0a. | License | Apache 2.0 / MIT / Unlicense |
| 0b. | Documentation | We will provide both inline documentation of the code and a basic tutorial that explains how a user can (for example) spin up one of our Substrate nodes. Once the node is up, it will be possible to send test transactions that will show how the new functionality works. |
| 0c. | Testing Guide | The code will have proper unit-test coverage (e.g. 90%) to ensure functionality and robustness. In the guide we will describe how to run these tests | 
| 1. | Substrate main Chain | We use Substrate to build the economic model of TransX, and reward transaction behavior. |  
| 2. | TransX APP | TransX APP is a receive payment client,don't store user private key. Every business can use it safely. |  
| 3. | TransX Wallet APP | TransX Wallet APP is a receive payment and pay wallet. store user private key and receive and payment could reward both. |  
| 4. | Introduce the first batch of internal beta users | Test in existing communities. |  
| 5. | Open Beta | Public testing after launching the mainnet |

### Milestone 2 Example — Additional features


### Community engagement

## Future Plans

In the second stage of TransX, if the success of the first stage is verified, after accumulating users, it wants to use blockchain technology to make unsecured small loans.  We have the runtime module of KYC, which extends digital currency payment to the consumer payment field. Microfinance is a logical business expansion.

## Additional Information :heavy_plus_sign: 

- There is a transfer function based on nickname on the TransX chain.

- The TransX chain has its own unique stable currency module, which uses sovereign state treasury bonds to mortgage and cooperates with centralized banks to issue legal and compliant stable coins.

- There is also the governance of payment rewards in various tokens on the TransX chain, which involves a wide range of aspects. You can refer to the white paper.
